# Tech-Blog-1.1

*I first start with trying to set up all of the differnt sections of the code.
*Then I started to work through each section setting up the code. I had to add to and move other files around to make it struched right.
*I still have a long way to go I think I have it all set up right I just have to work on making it run properly. I am still working on this.
*I still need to run it and then launch it on heroku, I will have to come back to that.
